  "title": "Migrating and caring for yourself: mental health for Latinos in the U.S.",
  "excerpt": "How migration affects emotional wellbeing and what can help.",
  "intro": [
    "Migration is not just moving; it’s reorganizing your entire life. For many Latinos in the U.S., the process brings deep changes in routine, language, social support and opportunities, with real impact on mood and stress.",
    "Mental health is influenced by economic, legal and social factors, and also human experiences like nostalgia, family separation and culture shock. Understanding these dimensions helps normalize our feelings and choose more conscious supports."
  ],
  "keyIdeas": [
    "Contemporary mass migration triggers public debates focused on economics and policy, often underestimating the psychological impact of adapting to a new culture.",
    "Feelings of loss, culture shock, grief for previous bonds and projects, plus language barriers, all heighten distress and emotional vulnerability.",
    "Adjustment takes time, resources and networks; when these are limited, weariness, anxiety and confusion increase—often eased by good information and support."
  ],
  "neuroView": {
    "stress": "In Latino communities, stress frequently builds up around work, paperwork, financial uncertainty and caregiving. The pressure to ‘make it’ can hide emotional exhaustion, especially for those supporting family here and back home.",
    "grief": "Migration grief includes multiple farewells: everyday language, places, roles and rhythms. Migrating isn’t a loss in itself; it’s recognizing ambivalence between new opportunities and what we leave behind—so we can build belonging without denying our history.",
    "identity": "Identity is reshaped across cultural codes, stereotypes and expectations. Living ‘between two worlds’ means negotiating who I am here, what I keep from my roots and what I learn from my environment—without losing dignity or voice."
  },
  "signals": [
    "Persistent fatigue, trouble sleeping or disconnecting",
    "Irritability, social anxiety or fear of calls and paperwork",
    "Intense nostalgia, feeling uprooted or alone",
    "Couple/family conflicts about roles, time or money",
    "Harsh self-criticism and difficulty asking for help"
  ],
  "actions": [
    "Practice short regulation routines: breathing, screen-free pauses, brief walks",
    "Build micro-networks: two or three people to share, ask favors and coordinate support",
    "Care for language and roots: music, food and celebrations that connect you to your culture",
    "Set sustainable limits: schedules, workload and message availability",
    "Use reliable information: understand systems (health, education, paperwork) to reduce uncertainty"
  ],
  "closure": "Migration is a complex psychosocial task. You deserve time, information and company to build wellbeing in a new context, without giving up your story. If this resonates, a conversation can offer clarity and concrete strategies.",
